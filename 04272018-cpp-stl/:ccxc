# Standard Template Library
## 04/27/2018

The Standard Template Library contains several data structures and algorithms that are common across programs and are also implemented in a generic way for developers to use.

### Working with `vector`

`vector` is a data structure for a randomly-accessed list and can be used as follows:

```C++
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    vector<int> v;
    v.push_back(2);
    v.push_back(3);

    // v = { 2, 3 }

    return 0;
}
```
